# Service Template

This is my opinionated template for Go microservices.

| :warning: WARNING :warning:: This is very much a work in progress, which I will continue to update as time permits. For those watching this repo, please be sure to pay attention to the github updates as they roll out. I made the decision to put this out in a _very_ incomplete state, because I feel that the evolution of a service from nothing to fully-formed is just as important as the service itself. |

The purpose of this repo? I've been writing services in Go for a _long_ time, and I've seen many permutations and 
revisions of what an idiomaticâ„¢ Go service looks like. This service is a representation of what works, in my opinion. 
Note that my [opinions](https://x.com/GoTimeFM/status/1402981188483092480) are not always widely-shared across the Go 
community, so keep that in mind as you go through this. I am sure there will be things you disagree with, and I'd be 
happy to discuss those things in the issues section of this repository.

# Coffee Shop Ordering System

Instead of the normal TODO List application that is the product of many sample apps, I've decided to create a coffee 
shop ordering system. The finished system will have the following features:
- Users can order items from a menu
  - For this exercise, "payments" are handled client-side, so incoming orders are already paid for (assume a payment ID as part of the order)
  - Users can opt-in for text updates when their order is being processed
- New orders get placed on a queue
  - Estimated "order ready" times are based on the size of the queue
  - An order has three states: `RECEIVED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, and `COMPLETE`
    - The barista changes the state of the order
- This coffee shop is not a Starbucks. The menu is pretty bare:
  - Drinks
    - Drip coffee
    - Latte
    - Cappuccino
    - Macchiato
    - Fizzy Water
  - Treats
    - Muffin
    - Brownie
    - Biscotti
- Users can check the status of their order
- Orders are tracked with some basic analytics/metadata:
  - Items in order
  - Order total
  - Time order placed
  - Time order marked complete
- Coffee shop owner can add/remove/alter menu items
